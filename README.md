What we did in this project, it's a Class that's in charge of the initialization, serealization and deserealization of our future instances.
We created a simple flow of serealization/deserealization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON chain <-> archive.
We created all of the classes utilyzed for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place...) that inherit the BaseModel.
We created the first abstract storage motor of the project: archive storage.
We created every unit test to validate all of our classes and the storage motor.
